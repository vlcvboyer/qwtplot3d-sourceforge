Unix
====

For building Qwt for Qt 2.x you need tmake. On SuSE it is hidden
in a package called qt-freebies. It can be downloaded from
http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/tmake.html.

You have to set TMAKEPATH to point
to your development environment and run tmake:

export TMAKEPATH=/usr/lib/tmake/linux-g++ # path depends on your system
tmake qwt.pro -o Makefile
make

If you like to build the examples:

cd examples
tmake examples.pro -o Makefile
make

Builds for Qt 3.x need qmake, that is official part of Qt 3.x.

qmake qwt.pro 
make

The designer plugin is available for Qt > 3.x only. You can build and 
install it with:

cd designer
qmake qwtplugin.pro
make
make install


If you like to build the examples:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro 
make

If you like to run the examples, don't forget to install the qwt libraries
or set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory of your local build.

qwt doesn't distribute binary unix packages. qwt.spec is a template
spec file for building rpm packages. Read the comments at the beginning 
of qwt.pro how to use it.

Win32
-----

Please read the qmake/tmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

For Visual Studio users, tmake/qmake can also generate '.dsp' files:
This is the default platform in the qwt project files on Win32 platforms. 
All you need to do is:

Qt < 3.0: tmake qwt.pro
Qt >= 3.0: qmake qwt.pro 

Good luck !
